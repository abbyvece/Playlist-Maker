Name: Abby Vece
- A summary of your program, including a list of Module 2 concepts used
    - This program makes up to five playlists that the user can title, and the playlists can include songs or podcasts. There is an inheritance class(Podcast is a song), a component class(Playlist has a song), and then there is file output, with the playlists being written to txt files
- Any known bugs at time of submission
  - I had trouble overloading the print operator for the podcasts, i wanted podcasts to print the episode number when print playlist was called, but I couldn't figure it out, but the program still compiles and runs
- Future work (how you could expand the program with more time)
  - I want to read in from txt files so the playlists are already there when the program starts, instead of having to start from no playlists
- Citations for any code not written by you or the instructor
- The grade you think you have earned, based on the grading rubric below, with justification
  - I think I earned an 80, my testing suite doesn't test as much as I think it could, and I'm not entirely sure my component class counts as a component class, but I am very proud of the work that I did with the inheritance class, and the main and all the other classes and getting them to work together.
