# Playlist Maker, Abby Vece
This program can make up to five playlists. The user can create playlists and add songs to them. The user can also add podcast episodes to these playlists. It uses C++ and concepts like inheritance to enhance the project. The program also writes all the songs to a file when done with the program.

In main, I use numeric_limits<streamsize> to help me clear a user input, which I found online at https://cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/217812/

I had a little bit of trouble with the overloading operators, so printing the podcasts to the txt files doesn't show the episode numbe rlike I wanted it to, so in the txt files it is hard to decipher what is what.
